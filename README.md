# CS50 Final Project 

## Overview

The project was to create a machine learning web application which predicts the probability of surviving the famous titanic ship-wreck based upon user input variables and the training dataset from Kaggle. It:

* Allows the user to input information and returns it to the server
* Feeds inputted data to the model (Random Forest Classifier)
* Produces a binary classification (1,0) and probability score
* Returns the result to the user
* Renders a template to explain the analysis behind the model to the user

A demo video (2 minutes) can be found at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UONtK24WVwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UONtK24WVwE).

The application can be accessed at: [http://ml-titanic-app.herokuapp.com/](http://ml-titanic-app.herokuapp.com/).
